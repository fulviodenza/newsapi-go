# newsapi-go
This project has the intent to provide a valid interface for newsapi (https://newsapi.org/).

# usage
The project is still under mantainance and will be released as soon as possible, actually the interface is quite trivial but will be improved.
To run the example main.go you should generate an api key here: https://newsapi.org/ and put it in the config-file.json in the field "apiKey".  

You should be able to modify the config-file.json to customize news generation.

The command `go run main.go` in your terminal should execute the example program.
